## Summary 

This repository contains information relating to my BHS 2020 final project. I am interested in looking at functional connectivity in resting state data in relation to behavioral and/or personality attributes collected from healthy participants. 

## Project definition 

### Background

I am a second year PhD student at McGill in the IPN program and I work in the labs of Robert Zatorre and Alain Dagher. I have both a music and psychology background. I am particularly interested in music reward processing and the reward system, particularly in terms of psychopathology,focusing on apathy and anhedonia. 

My aim is to gain experience with fMRI preprocessing and resting state connectivity analysis. I plan to work on a single participant's data first and then create a pipeline from there, and thus use my project as a jumping off point.

### Tools 

This project will utilize the following tools: 
 * Github (for data management and collaboration purposes)
 * FSL (for data preprocessing and analysis)
 * Python (for the data anlysis)
 
### Data 

I am using data that I have collected as part of a larger EEG-fMRI project in my lab examining the use of music neurofeeback in nucleus accumbens upregulation. Participants came in for an initial session where they completed questionnaires and behavioral tasks related to reward as well as an fMRI session where they underwent both structural and functional scans, including resting state and a music listening task. For my project, I will focus on the resting state data and conduct an ROI-based analysis focused on the DMN and salience networks. I also plan to correlate the neural findings with the behavioral data that I have.
